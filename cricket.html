    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th
      century England. It became an established sport in the country in the 18th
      century and developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries.
      International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal
      Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cricket is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has
      over one hundred countries and territories in membership, though only
      twelve currently play Test cricket.
    </p>
    <h3>Rule of the game</h3>
    <p>
      One player on each team acts as captain. There are two umpires—one
      standing behind the bowler’s wicket, the other at the position called
      square leg about 15 yards from the batsman’s popping crease (see the
      figure)—to control the game according to the laws; two scorers record its
      progress. The object of the game is for one side to score more runs than
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the start of a match, the captain who wins the toss of a coin decides
      whether his own or the other side shall take first innings—i.e., proceed
      successively as batsmen, the first two as a pair together, to the wicket
      and try to make as many runs as possible against the bowling and fielding
      of their opponents.

      <dt> Bat</dt>
      <dl>The blade of the paddle-shaped bat is made of willow and must not be broader 
        than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm). The length of the bat, including the handle, must 
        not exceed 38 inches (96.5 cm). </dl>
        
      
      <dt> Ball</dt>
      <dl>The ball, which has a core of cork built up with string, was traditionally
         encased in polished red leather, although white is now frequently used, especially 
         for night games. Slightly smaller, harder, and heavier than a baseball, it must weigh between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces
           (156 and 163 grams) and measure between 8.8 and 9 inches (22.4 and 22.9 cm) in circumference.</dl>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
      kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally
      means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is
      used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has
       a long history. Football in its current form arose in England in the middle
        of the 19th century. But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier
         and are a part of the football history.

    <h3>Rules of Football</h3>

      <li>
        A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute rest period
        in between.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who
        is the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box)
        and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular
        shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must
        take place.
      </li>
      <li>
        The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Equipments</h3>
    <dt> Helmet</dt>
    <dl>The most important item on any football equipment list is a helmet,
       which protects the head from injury during games and practice. Helmets 
       are designed to protect the head from impact caused by flying balls as
        well as blunt force from the ground and other players.</dl>
       <br> </br>
    <dt>Jockstrap and cup</dt>
    <dl> Protecting the groin is crucial in a game of football, which can be hazardous
       to any region that incurs severe impact. With a cup worn for protection at all
        times on the field, there's less risk of injury to this sensitive area.</dl>
        <br></br>
    <dt> Gloves</dt>
    <dl>As one of the world's most hands-on sports, it's important that football players
       keep their hands free of injury. Certain players are more susceptible to hand injury than others,
        including receivers and linemen. Skill players often wear gloves to help catch and hold onto
         the ball, where as lineman usually wear gloves to protect from bruising and scratching. </dl>

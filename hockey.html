    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      Games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in the histories
      of many cultures. By the 19th century, the various forms and divisions of
      historic games began to differentiate and coalesce into the individual
      sports defined today. Organizations dedicated to the codification of rules
      and regulations began to form, and national and international bodies
      sprang up to manage domestic and international competition.

    <dl>
      Hockey sticks are an essential piece of equipment for any hockey player. A
      wide variety of sticks is available, from wooden to composite materials.
      When selecting a stick, consider your playing style and determine the size
      and weight best suit you. For example, senior hockey sticks are typically
      longer and weight more than intermediate hockey sticks.

      Hockey helmets are critical in the game. Theyâ€™re necessary to ensure
      safety and safeguard players from potential harm. When choosing a helmet,
      finding one that fits properly and is comfortable is essential.Wearing the
      right size is the most important part of buying a new helmet. You should
      also consider any additional padding or liners necessary for proper
      fitment.

    <dl>
      Gloves must fit snugly to protect your hands from falls and pucks flying
      at high speeds without restricting movement. Look for reinforced palms, as
      these areas bear the brunt of contact with surfaces like boards and rink
      walls during games. You want the padding to be ample along knuckles and
      fingers, where the impact could occur in gameplay. Investing in quality
      gloves that can withstand wear and tear is well worth the money you spend
      on them.

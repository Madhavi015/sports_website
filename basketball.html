    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
      Basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a
      rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing
      the ball through the opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net
      called a basket.
    </p>

    <p>
      For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two
      half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the sport its name. The students
      were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting, William R. Chase made
      a midcourt shot—the only score in that historic contest.

    <p>The standard American basketball court is in the shape of a rectangle 50 feet
         (15.2 meters) by 94 feet (28.7 meters); high school courts may be slightly 
         smaller. There are various markings on the court, including a center circle,
          free throw lanes, and a three-point line, that help regulate play. A goal, 
          or basket, 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter is suspended from a backboard at each
           end of the court. </p>
    
           <p> The metal rim of the basket is 10 feet (3 meters) above the floor.
             In the professional game the backboard is a rectangle, 6 feet (1.8 meters) wide 
             and 3.5 feet (1.1 meters) high, made of a transparent material, usually glass; 
             it may be 4 feet (1.2 meters) high in college. The international court varies
              somewhat in size and markings. The spherical inflated ball used in men’s basketball
               measures 29.5 inches (76 cm) in circumference and weighs 22 ounces (624 grams); the
                women’s ball is 28.5 inches (72 cm) in circumference and weighs 20 ounces (567 grams).</p>
